<h2>Who I am</h2>
<p>I'm primarily a front-end developer, but I follow my curiousity. My development interests currently include:</p>
<ul style=" list-style-type: '- '; padding: 0 1.5em;">
<li>Javascript, HTML, CSS, Web Components</li>
<li>Node, PHP, perl, etc.</li>
<li>Serverless development (for example, Firebase)</li>
<li>Robust API development</li>
<li>Frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte)</li>
<li>Frameless (pure javascript!)</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I do?</h2>
<p>I am constantly tinkering, and there are always projects in the works. Here are a few I've really enjoyed:</p>
<div class="card" style="border: 1px; padding: 2em; }
ul { list-style-type: "- "; padding: 0 1.5em;">
<h3>ES6 Timer Class</h3>
<p>When I was first learning about the class syntax in ES6, I wanted to see if I could create some abstract components with it. The intent was, at the time, to build the components needed for a Pomodoro Timer type project, similar to the projects from FreeCodeCamp and others, but using pure JS rather than frameworks.</p>
